                # GETTING STARTED

                # WHAT THIS IS USED FOR

                This app is intended to be used as a custom python package and imported into a python file for consumption.
                The goal is to make the connection process to the API more abstract and easier to handle for users.

                Example:
                    requests.get('https://some_api_route.com')

                    classobject.start()
                        -- Does the same thing but the user just has to make an object and call the start function.

                # Things like Authorization can be implemented
                # This package can be pip installed
