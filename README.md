                # WHAT THIS IS USED FOR

                A light-weight communication layer.

                This app is intended to be used as a custom python 
                package and imported into a python file for consumption. 
                The goal is to make the connection process to the API 
                more abstract and easier to handle for users.

                Example: requests.get('https://some_api_route.com')

                    classobject.start() -- Does the same thing but the 
                        user just has to make an object and call the 
                        start function.

                # Things like Authorization can be implemented This 
                # package can be pip installed
